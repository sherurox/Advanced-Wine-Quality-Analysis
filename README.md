This repository hosts a comprehensive machine learning system for predicting wine quality based on detailed physicochemical measurements—such as alcohol content, acidity, sulfur levels, and more. The project leverages ensemble modeling (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Neural Networks) to achieve robust performance and uses explainable AI techniques (e.g., SHAP) to provide transparent insights into how each feature impacts the final quality score. By combining these approaches, the solution not only delivers highly accurate predictions of expert ratings but also highlights the key factors driving wine excellence.

This experimental module leverages **Qiskit** and the **qiskit_machine_learning** package to create a quantum-enhanced model for wine quality prediction. At this stage, the training functionality is a placeholder, and the primary purpose is to demonstrate how quantum circuits can be integrated into the predictive framework.

We invite contributors and researchers to extend this module and help realize the potential of quantum computing in this domain.
